# AdofaiCSL

Custom song loader for non-workshop levels.

## Instructions

Open adofai once with the mod installed, this will create a folder called `CustomSongs` in the game directory.

### Add level

1. Inside the `CustomSongs` folder, create a new folder, this will be the root of your level.
2. Add your `main.adofai` chart file and any other needed files to the folder.

### Add pack

1. Inside the `CustomSongs` folder, create a new folder, this will be the root of your pack.
2. Inside the new folder, create a `main.pack` file.
3. Open the pack file in a text editor and paste in the [template](https://pastebin.com/raw/GRd0zAJk). The difficulty is a number between 1 and 10, and the color is a valid hex color code.
4. Add an image and an icon by setting the properties config (optional), [example](https://pastebin.com/raw/9GBX2TDB).
5. You can add levels and (ONLY ON MOD VERSION 2.3.0 AND LATER) packs in it.
