# AdofaiCSL

Custom song loader for non-workshop levels.

## Instructions

Open adofai once with the mod installed, this will create a folder called `CustomSongs` in the game directory.

### Add level

1. Inside the `CustomSongs` folder, create a new folder, this will be the root of your level.
2. Add your `.adofai` file and any other needed files to the folder (make sure the level file is called main.adofai)

### Create pack

1. Inside the `CustomSongs` folder, create a new folder, this will be the root of your pack.
2. Inside the new folder, create a new file ending in `.pack`. The file name does not matter.
3. Open the pack file in a text editor and paste in the [template](https://pastebin.com/raw/GRd0zAJk). The difficulty should be a number between 1 and 8, and the color should be a valid hex color code.
4. Add an image and an icon by setting the properties in the pack file (optional). [Example](https://pastebin.com/raw/9GBX2TDB).
5. Add a level by creating a new folder and adding the `.adofai` file and any other needed files in it (make sure the level file is called main.adofai)
